# Git Branching Strategy for ASIL Lakehouse POC

## 🎯 Quick Answer

**For your current situation (initial setup):**
- ✅ Push current changes to `main` branch
- ✅ This is your "foundation" commit
- ✅ After this, use feature branches for all development

**For future development:**
- ✅ Create a feature branch for each task/feature
- ✅ Never commit directly to `main`
- ✅ Use Pull Requests to merge into `main`

---

## 📋 Current Situation: Initial Setup

### What You Have Now
- Project structure created
- Documentation organized
- Configuration files (.env.example, docker-compose.yml, .gitignore)
- Python dependencies installed (venv)
- No actual code yet

### What To Do RIGHT NOW

```bash
# 1. Check your current status
git status

# 2. Stage all the initial setup files
git add .

# 3. Commit the foundation
git commit -m "chore: initial project setup

- Create project directory structure
- Add Python package __init__.py files
- Configure Docker Compose for services
- Organize documentation in docs/ folder
- Set up .gitignore and .env.example
- Add comprehensive README and guides

This establishes the foundation for the ASIL Lakehouse POC project."

# 4. Push to main branch (first time)
git push origin main
```

**Why push to main now?**
- ✅ This is your project foundation/skeleton
- ✅ No actual features yet, just setup
- ✅ Establishes the baseline for all future work
- ✅ Team members can clone and start working

## 🌳 Branching Strategy Going Forward

### Branch Types

```
main (protected)
  ├── feature/milestone-1-docker-setup
  ├── feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema
  ├── feature/milestone-2-etl-extraction
  ├── feature/milestone-2-etl-transform
  ├── feature/milestone-3-ai-agent-api
  └── bugfix/fix-postgres-connection
```

### 1. **main** Branch
- **Purpose:** Production-ready code
- **Protection:** Should be protected (require PR reviews)
- **Rules:**
  - ❌ Never commit directly
  - ✅ Only merge via Pull Requests
  - ✅ Always keep stable and working

### 2. **feature/** Branches
- **Purpose:** Develop new features or tasks
- **Naming:** `feature/<milestone>-<task-name>`
- **Examples:**
  ```
  feature/milestone-1-docker-setup
  feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema
  feature/milestone-2-etl-extraction
  feature/milestone-3-ai-query-parser
  ```

### 3. **bugfix/** Branches
- **Purpose:** Fix bugs
- **Naming:** `bugfix/<issue-description>`
- **Examples:**
  ```
  bugfix/fix-postgres-connection
  bugfix/fix-minio-upload-error
  ```

### 4. **docs/** Branches (Optional)
- **Purpose:** Documentation-only changes
- **Naming:** `docs/<description>`
- **Examples:**
  ```
  docs/update-api-documentation
  docs/add-architecture-diagrams
  ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### For Each Task/Feature

```bash
# 1. Start from updated main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema

# 3. Do your work
# - Write code
# - Test locally
# - Commit frequently

# 4. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(database): implement PostgreSQL schema

- Create users, posts, comments, likes tables
- Add indexes for performance
- Include sample data seed script

Implements requirements FR-DB-001 through FR-DB-005"

# 5. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema

# 6. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# - Go to GitHub repository
# - Click "Compare & pull request"
# - Add description referencing PRD requirements
# - Request review (if working with team)

# 7. After PR is approved and merged
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema  # Delete local branch
```

## 📝 Task-Based Branching Examples

### Example 1: Milestone 1 - Task 1 (Docker Setup)

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b feature/milestone-1-docker-setup

# Work on task
# - Create Dockerfiles
# - Configure docker-compose
# - Test services

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(docker): set up Docker environment

- Add Dockerfile for AI agent service
- Add Dockerfile for ETL service
- Configure PostgreSQL and MinIO services
- Add health checks

Addresses Milestone 1, Task 1"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/milestone-1-docker-setup
```

### Example 2: Milestone 2 - Task 1 (ETL Extraction)

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b feature/milestone-2-etl-extraction

# Work on task
# - Implement extraction logic
# - Add tests
# - Update documentation

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(etl): implement data extraction module

- Add PostgreSQL data extraction
- Implement batch processing
- Add error handling and logging
- Include unit tests

Implements FR-ETL-001 through FR-ETL-004"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/milestone-2-etl-extraction
```

## 🎯 Recommended Approach for Your Project

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (NOW)
```bash
# Push foundation to main
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial project setup"
git push origin main
```

### Phase 2: Milestone 1 Development
```bash
# Task 1: Docker Setup
git checkout -b feature/milestone-1-docker-setup
# ... work ...
git push origin feature/milestone-1-docker-setup
# Create PR → Merge to main

# Task 2: PostgreSQL Schema
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema
# ... work ...
git push origin feature/milestone-1-postgres-schema
# Create PR → Merge to main

# Task 3: Sample Data
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/milestone-1-sample-data
# ... work ...
git push origin feature/milestone-1-sample-data
# Create PR → Merge to main
```

### Phase 3: Continue Pattern for All Milestones
- One branch per task
- Always start from updated `main`
- Always merge via Pull Request

## 🤔 Should Each Task Have a Separate Branch?

### ✅ YES - Create Separate Branches When:

1. **Task is independent**
   - Can be developed separately
   - Doesn't depend on other incomplete tasks
   - Example: PostgreSQL schema vs MinIO setup

2. **Task is substantial**
   - Takes more than 1-2 hours
   - Involves multiple files
   - Needs testing and review

3. **Task is a milestone deliverable**
   - Represents a complete feature
   - Can be demonstrated independently
   - Example: Complete ETL extraction module

### ❌ NO - Can Combine in One Branch When:

1. **Tasks are tightly coupled**
   - One depends on the other
   - Can't be tested separately
   - Example: Database schema + seed data script

2. **Tasks are very small**
   - Quick fixes or updates
